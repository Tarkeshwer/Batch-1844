    "\n",
    "Ans: K-Means clustering algorithm is sensetive to outlier, because a mean is easly influenced by extream value. K-medoids clustring is a variant of k-means that is more rebust to noise and outliers. The algorithm aims to minimize the squared Euclidean distances between the observation and the centroid of cluster to which it belongs. But sometime K-Means algorithm does not give best results. It is sensitive to outliers.     "

    "Ans: The basicaly k-means clustering is based on a non-deterministic algorithm. it is One of the significant drawbacks. This means that running the algorithm several times on the same data, could give different results. it start with random set of data points as initial centroids.
